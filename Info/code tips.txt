For a single user simply put this at the start: if (!message.author.id == "YOUR ACCOUNT ID") return message.reply("Sorry but you can't use this command")
For multiply: if (!message.author.some(r=>["ACCOUNT ID1", "ACCOUNT ID2"].includes(r.id)) ) return message.reply("Sorry but you can't use this command")
client.on("message", async message => { // Kick command
    if (command === "kick") {
        if (message.member.roles.some(r => ["Administrator", "Moderator"].includes(r.name)))
            return message.reply("Sorry, you don't have permissions to use this!");
        let member = message.mentions.members.first();
        if (!member)
            return message.reply("Please mention a valid member of this server");
        if (!member.kickable)
            return message.reply("I cannot kick this user! Do they have a higher role? Do I have kick permissions?");
        let reason = args.slice(1).join(' ');
        if (!reason)
            return message.reply("Please indicate a reason for the kick!");
        await member.kick(reason)
        console.catch(error => message.reply(`Sorry ${message.author} I couldn't kick because of : ${error}`));
        message.reply(`${member.user.tag} has been kicked by ${message.author.tag} because: ${reason}`);
    });
